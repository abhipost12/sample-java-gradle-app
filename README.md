``` groovy

plugins {

    id 'maven-publish'
}

group = rootProject.group
version = rootProject.version

repositories {
    maven {
        name = "maven-public"
        url  = "http://localhost:8081/repository/maven-public/"
        allowInsecureProtocol = true
    }
    mavenLocal()
}

...

publishing {
    publications {
        library(MavenPublication) {
            artifactId = rootProject.name

            from components.java

            pom {
                name = 'Simple Application for Java Gradle'

            def snapshotsRepoUrl = "http://localhost:8081/repository/maven-snapshots/"

            name = "maven-publish"
            url = project.version.endsWith('SNAPSHOT') ? snapshotsRepoUrl : releasesRepoUrl
            allowInsecureProtocol = true
            credentials {
                username = "admin"
